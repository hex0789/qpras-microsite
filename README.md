# QPRAS Microsite – Quantum Programming Reality Alteration System

This is the official microsite for the **QPRAS Project**, developed by Professor Hector Ortiz Jr.  
It serves as the public-facing proof of concept for a research initiative exploring quantum-influenced decision structures, ethical AI, and real-world influence convergence through probabilistic modeling.

## 🌌 What is QPRAS?

QPRAS (Quantum Programming Reality Alteration System) integrates:
- Quantum computation theory
- Multiversal decision structures
- Reinforced AI behavioral nudging
- Ethically guided probabilistic influence models

The system is designed not to control reality, but to guide its evolution—subtly increasing the likelihood of globally beneficial outcomes.

## 🧠 Microsite Purpose

This site introduces the vision of QPRAS and provides an open channel for:
- Donations to support ongoing research
- Public engagement with quantum-informed cognitive theory
- Transparent logging of influence convergence (coming soon)
